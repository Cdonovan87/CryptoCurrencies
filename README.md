# CryptoCurrencies
For this challenge I was tasked with creating a unsupervised machine learning model for cryptoCurrency. The client was looking to create a new crypto investment portfolio for its customers. I was tasked with creating a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
